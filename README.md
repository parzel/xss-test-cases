# XSS Test Cases

These are some XSS test cases I developed for my master thesis to improve on some test from ```https://public-firing-range.appspot.com/```.
The cases are mainly either new or more restrictive then the ones on Firing Range.

## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/parzel/xss-test-cases.git
cd xss-test-cases
php -S 127.0.0.1:9090
```

Instance should be here ```http://127.0.0.1:9090```

## Disclaimer
Do not use this as an example on how to prevent XSS it is completely false :-)
